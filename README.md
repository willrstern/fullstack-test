# FullStack Developer Test

> Javascript coding test for fullstack developers @ CMN.


### Objective

Show proficiency with creating a fullstack Javascript application as simple or complex
as you'd like to the best exhibit of your capabilities.


### Getting Started

- [ ] Fork this repository
- [ ] Solve both the [UI Requirements](#ui-requirements) & [Technical Requirements](#technical-requirements)
- [ ] Send a Pull Request


**Remember, for all of the requirements below, the complexity of the solution is up to you.**
If you're most familiar with a specific library or framework, by all means use it!
*(Solving problems often means doing what's most easily supported, reliable, and familiar)*


### UI Requirements

*CSS styling is entirely optional.*

- [ ] List of contacts in left-pane.
- [ ] By default, right-pane is empty.
- [ ] User selects a contact from the left-pane, which will then populate the right-pane.
- [ ] User selects a different contact, and the right-pane will reflect that change.


Take a deep breath, because here comes some awesome!
